* Add side tab to each page to as navbar
    - Shows all pages but only enables the one the user has visited (via local storage most likely)

* Check if user has lost the game
    - If so, store in local storage and redirect all pages to "No longer considered" page

* Another puzzle?

* Another step after application submission?
    - Maybe send user an email to the next stage
